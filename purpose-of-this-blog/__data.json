I’m guilty of that too! This blog was created mainly for that - sharing about development stuff that I like or that I’m learning.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe purpose is to help myself learn about the subjects better, since there’s no better way to learn than trying to reach someone. Of course, it won’t be made of tutorials only - I intend to write about some theoretical concepts, and maybe tech stuff not related to development.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI consider myself a tech enthusiast. Which means I like to talk about software and gadgets in a way that most other people would find me annoying. This can be a great place to be able to share this with people that may care, hopefully you!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI hope to see you here in future posts, and I hope you enjoy reading what I have to say!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",{"code":10,"map":11},"",null,"1 min read",[]],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}},null]}
