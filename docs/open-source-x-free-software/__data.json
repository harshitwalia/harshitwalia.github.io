It does not deal with the user’s freedom, only with the technical aspects of the software. Richard Stallman, the founder on FSF, summarized really well the differences between the two concepts:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe terms “free software” and “open source” stand for almost the same range of programs. However, they say deeply different things about those programs, based on different values. The free software movement campaigns for freedom for the users of computing; it is a movement for freedom and justice. By contrast, the open source idea values mainly practical advantage and does not campaign for principles. - Richard Stallman\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can read more about it \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.gnu.org\u002Fphilosophy\u002Fopen-source-misses-the-point.en.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ehere\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2 id=\"tldr\"\u003ETL;DR\u003Ca aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#tldr\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"heading-link\"\u003E#\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOpen Source is a technical, practical concept.
