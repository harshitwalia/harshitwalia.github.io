  return `<p>Free software is a concept that’s been around for a long time, and so is open source. At first glance, they may seem like the same thing with different names. However, they are very different in their philosophy. In this article, I’ll explain what each one is and how they are different.</p>
<h2 id="${"free-software"}">Free Software<a aria-hidden="${"true"}" tabindex="${"-1"}" href="${"#free-software"}"><span class="${"heading-link"}">#</span></a></h2>
<p>According to the <a href="${"https://www.fsf.org/"}" rel="${"nofollow noopener noreferrer"}" target="${"_blank"}">Free Software Foundation (FSF)</a>, free software is the software that respects the user’s freedom and sense of community. This means that the user has the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve it.</p>
<p>A common phrase you may read somewhere is “Free as in freedom, not as in beer”. This means that the name doesn’t indicate that the software is free of charge, only that the user has the freedom to do whatever they want with it.</p>
<p>The FSF lists four essential freedoms that every free software must follow:</p>
<ul><li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0);</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this;</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2);</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li></ul>
<p>You can read more about Free Software at gnu.org, <a href="${"https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html"}" rel="${"nofollow noopener noreferrer"}" target="${"_blank"}">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="${"open-source"}">Open Source<a aria-hidden="${"true"}" tabindex="${"-1"}" href="${"#open-source"}"><span class="${"heading-link"}">#</span></a></h2>
<p>The <a href="${"https://opensource.org/"}" rel="${"nofollow noopener noreferrer"}" target="${"_blank"}">Open Source Initiative</a> defines 10 criteria for software to be considered open source. You can read them fully <a href="${"https://opensource.org/docs/definition.php"}" rel="${"nofollow noopener noreferrer"}" target="${"_blank"}">here</a>. I’ll summarize them below:</p>
<ul><li>Any person must be able to distribute or sell the software without restrictions;</li>
<li>The source code must be distributed along with the software, or at least link to it clearly;</li>
<li>A copy of the license must be distributed with the software;</li>
<li>People must be able to modify your software and redistribute it with the same license;</li>
<li>Modifications must only be redistributed with a different name or version than the original code;</li></ul>
<h2 id="${"the-difference"}">The Difference<a aria-hidden="${"true"}" tabindex="${"-1"}" href="${"#the-difference"}"><span class="${"heading-link"}">#</span></a></h2>
<p>By reading each concept’s principles above, you can get the idea that Open Source is a more neutral concept when compared to Free Software. It does not deal with the user’s freedom, only with the technical aspects of the software. Richard Stallman, the founder on FSF, summarized really well the differences between the two concepts:</p>
<blockquote><p>The terms “free software” and “open source” stand for almost the same range of programs. However, they say deeply different things about those programs, based on different values. The free software movement campaigns for freedom for the users of computing; it is a movement for freedom and justice. By contrast, the open source idea values mainly practical advantage and does not campaign for principles. - Richard Stallman</p></blockquote>
<p>You can read more about it <a href="${"https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.en.html"}" rel="${"nofollow noopener noreferrer"}" target="${"_blank"}">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="${"tldr"}">TL;DR<a aria-hidden="${"true"}" tabindex="${"-1"}" href="${"#tldr"}"><span class="${"heading-link"}">#</span></a></h2>
<p>Open Source is a technical, practical concept. Free Software is a philosophical, broader concept. Since Free Software already considers the technical aspects of Open Source, we can say that <strong>Every Free Software is Open Source, but not every Open Source is Free Software</strong>.</p>

<p>The easiest way is to check their license. <a href="${"https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#SoftwareLicenses"}" rel="${"nofollow noopener noreferrer"}" target="${"_blank"}">The FSF lists all Free Software licenses here</a>, but usually most of them are under the GPL or MIT licenses.</p>

<blockquote><p>We are tired of writing crap. That’s it. The fat lady sang. Good nite Gracy. Over and out.</p></blockquote>
<p>We’re tired of writing crap. We are tired of embarrassing ourselves and our employers by delivering lousy software.
We have had enough of telling our customers to reboot at midnight. We don’t want bug lists that are a thousand pages long.
We don’t want code that grows more tangled and corrupt with every passing day. We’re tired of doing a bad job.
We want to start doing a good job.</p>

<li>We will honor our team by testing everything that can be tested.</li>

<p>I suppose that some people might look askance at our code katas and our code retreats, and our practice sessions.
They might think that we’re turning inwards and abandoning our customers. They might think that we’ve given up on the
real world and have yielded to the temptation to entertain ourselves. I can see how someone might come to that conclusion.</p>
<p>But they are as wrong as the day is long. We are doing this because we care about the customer. We are dedicating time
and effort to being the best that we can be so that our employers will get the best possible value out of us.</p>
<blockquote><p>Do you think the only time musicians play their instruments is when they are on stage? Do you think the only time that batters hit balls is during games? Do you think the only time lawyers give a closing is at trial? Of course not. These people are professionals; and professionals practice! Professionals study the minutia of their disciplines. Professionals know all the little tricks and quirks. They know the history, the theories, the anecdotes. They know techniques and methods. They know good options and bad options and how to tell them apart. And they know all this stuff because they practice, practice practice.</p></blockquote>
<p>So when you see someone wearing a green wrist-band that says “Clean Code” or “Test First” or “Test Obsessed”, it’s not
because they’ve joined a movement, or signed a manifesto, or that they somehow feel superior to everyone else.
They aren’t participants in a holy war. They aren’t trying to join a tribe and huddle around a campfire.
The green band is a personal thing. It’s a promise made to one’s self: </p>
<blockquote><p>“I will do a good job. I will not rush. I will write tests. I will go fast by going well. I will not write crap. And I will practice, practice practice so that I can be a professional.”</p></blockquote>
